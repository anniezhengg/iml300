    <p>my reflection looks the same, just a decade older
        <br>but the way she stands,
        <br>sheltering herself to the world,
        <br>and the way she stares back,
        <br>i can tell that there is distance between me,
        <br>her,
        <br>and the memories behind our eyes.
        <br><br>the flowers are long gone.
        <br>she is a stranger i would embrace, a friend i would turn away. <br>she is everything i fear yet everything i have become.
        <br>she has been broken into a million shards that i don’t recognize. <br><a href="page-4.html">has she forgotten about me</a>?
        <br><br><a href="second-arc-2a.html">eyes</a>
