        <p>my reflection looks the same, just a decade older
            <br>but the way she stands,
            <br>sheltering herself to the world,
            <br>and the way she stares back,
            <br>i can tell that there is distance between me,
            <br>her,
            <br>and the memories behind our eyes.
            <br><br>the flowers are long gone.
            <br>she is a stranger i would embrace, <br>a friend i would turn away. <br>she is everything i fear <br>yet everything i have become.
            <br>she has been broken into a million shards <br>that i don’t recognize. <br><a href="page-4.html" class="mouse">has she forgotten about me?</a>
