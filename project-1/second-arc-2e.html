    <p>i hate my thighs. 
<br><br>i wore a skirt that day 
<br>i’d worn skirts around you before. 
<br>has no always meant yes for you? 
<br><br>every time i zip my uniformed skirt up for school i feel the ghost of your hands travelling up up up until i suffocate under you 
<br>i sit cross-legged because of you 
<br>i hate how every time i grip my thighs out of stress i look down and it’s your hands not mine and i’m cornered a prisoner in my own skin betrayed by my own body my own mind and i can no longer see my own reflection in the mirror 
<br><br>you took <a href="second-arc-1b.html">everything</a> from me. 
<br><br>how does it feel?</p>
