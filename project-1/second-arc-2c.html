<body>
    <p>i hate my boobs.
        <br><br>looking turned to touching and touching turned to silence
        <br>your words are written over the hills and the dips of my breasts and there are none of mine.
        <br><br>nothing.
        <br><br>silence.
        <br><br>i hate the lack of power i possess over my femininity and i hate that i cannot change before mirrors anymore without feeling so isolated from a part of my body that should be mine
        <br>so i look at them now with no emotion.
        <br>lumps of fat and tissue.
        <br>because the other option means that i'll have to relive your <a href="second-arc-1b.html">lies</a> again.
