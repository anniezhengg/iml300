    <p>i hate my lips. 
<br><br>your lips on mine 
<br>i don’t remember saying yes 
<br>you stole my first from me. 
<br><br>did you know that every time someone asks me about my first kiss, <br>i tell them that it was some guy named dylan or noah <br>or maybe liam <br>and sometimes i'll even throw in some made-up details about movie theater dates or amusement park fairs 
<br>but when i'm left to myself again and the facade falls, 
<br>my own lips feel like an <a href="second-arc-1b.html">intruder</a> on my face.</p>
