    <p>lately, i’ve been feeling <a href="page-5-first-arc-route-1a.html">lonely</a>.
        <br>i wonder if my reflection feels it too.
        <br>she looks different, feels foreign.
        <br>when i call <a href="second-arc-1a.html">her name</a> she doesn’t respond.
        <br><br>i don’t recognize her anymore.
    </p>
