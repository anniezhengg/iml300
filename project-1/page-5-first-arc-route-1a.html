    <p>the fields don’t have any more flowers
        <br>i’ve picked them all for bouquets that i have no one to give to <br>there’s no more space on my skin for painted petals of pink and blue
        <br>the sun blazes for too long, drying the flowers on my head to dead shells of a life that i’m tired of living
        <br>i want something
