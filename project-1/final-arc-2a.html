    <p>"what happened to you?"
        <br><br>"shhhhh...i want you to listen to me. i’m sorry i couldn’t do better for you. i could’ve carved out another path for you, led you through the forest unscathed. but you’ve already met him. and i was too late."
        <br><br>"i don’t know what you’ve been through, but i want you to know...
        this isn’t a story about him, it’s about you.
        about your relationship with your body and your heart,
        about how you should see and treat yourself,
        it’s a story of healing."
        <br><br>"i don’t think i can."
        <br><br>"i may not know a lot right now, but i know that we’re the same.
        strong,
        hopeful,
        enough."
        <br><br>"i’m sorry for forgetting about you."
        <br><br>"don’t be. you didn’t actually forget about me. i’ve always been here, you just chose not to look in the mirror, to look within you. we’re the same. you protect me and i’ll help you heal. we need each other."
