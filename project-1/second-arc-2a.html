    <p>i hate my eyes. 
<br><br>i used to think my eyes were my best feature, unique in their shape and their shine 
 <br>you used to tell me you could see the stories in my head unfold just by looking into my eyes 
<br>but i only see your stories in my eyes now. 
<br>your eyes where mine should be. 
<br>your control over what i see over my body. <br><br>i cannot figure out how to <a href="second-arc-1b.html">untether</a> your gaze from mine.
