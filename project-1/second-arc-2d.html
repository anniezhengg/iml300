<body>
    <p>i hate my waist.
        <br><br>you always called me fat. <br>as a joke, apparently.
        <br>yet you still traced your fingers over my curves
        <br>cutting invisible scars into soft unscathed flesh
        <br>am i pretty yet like this?
        <br><br>it started with playful pokes and jabs
        <br>that was fine, <br>i think, <br>or maybe not, <br>i don’t know anymore.
        <br>so when did you start claiming a body that was never yours in the first place?
        <br>when did you permit your wandering fingers to grab at the curves of my body?
        <br>why did you pinch and prod and caress and convince me that this was <br><br><b><a href="second-arc-1b.html">love</a></b>?
    </p>
