[flower girl](http://anniezhengg.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web experience of self-discovery, self-doubt, and healing.


### Description

The mirror should never be a place of dread and your reflection should never be a stranger, but in "flower girl", the two sides of the mirror contain two very different worlds, suspended in different times. On one side, my childhood self sees herself in a field of flowers, carefree and caught up in her imagination, eager to see the world and meet new people. On the other side, my present self has refused to look in the mirror for years, terrified of who, or what, will stare back at her. Gone are the flowers in her hair and the hope she had for her dreams, replaced with broken promises and regret-filled insecurities. "flower girl" unites the two sides and promotes a conversation of strength and healing, for the viewer and for me.
