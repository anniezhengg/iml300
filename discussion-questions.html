        <h1>Summaries</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p class="text">In “How to Internet”, Jenny Odell reminisces about the spontaneity of connection with strangers in the superhighway days of the Internet. She laments that the excitement associated with the newness of the Internet’s capabilities barely exist in today’s age of carefully filtered online spaces, and urges us to find new ways to recapture the unrefined yet distinctively human forms of connection by reimagining our current systems. Laurel Schwulst provides a possible solution, tackling what it means to create a website today and the consequent responsibilities we have in making the web a more expressive, inclusive, and individuality-driven space. She uses metaphors to demonstrate the endless possibilities of what websites can be used for and what they can mean. One of my favorites is thinking of a website as a puddle – creating it whenever and being okay with its temporary and incomplete nature, then knowing that where there’s a hole, another puddle (or website/idea) will form again some day. Molly Soda’s website is the ultimate example of injecting our identities into websites through her commentary on corporate controlled content on social media. Its layout and content are unapologetically unique to her style and the interactivity of her website leads viewers down a rabbit hole of her thoughts on digital culture. </p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p class="text">It was so fascinating being able to examine the Internet in a different way through understanding where it came from and how we each relate to its future. Knowing that today, computer programming is widely regarded as a male-dominated field, I never thought that women were the building blocks of it. It was so frustrating to see their existence dwindle when corporations began realizing the potential of this field and pushing the narrative that it was a man’s job. As well, it was interesting to learn that the internet is actually sustained and made up of its users, so the internet is truly what we make of it. But, we need to start shifting away from corporations dominating the internet to individuals shaping it in order to make it benefit the people more. Looking at the internet now, it seems more and more like a reflection of how our world in general is run – there are major gender inequalities in the field and our world is heavily corporate controlled. I truly wonder how our society would be different if we are able to begin making the internet a space for the individual to thrive.</p>
       <h2>Week 4</h2> 
       <p class="text">“Black Gooey Universe” follows the development of technology within Silicon Valley through a racial lens, examining the anti-blackness that has been incorporated into GUI. It emphasizes that the white-dominated corporations replaced the black screen with a white one, erasing Blackness in the same way as the social and historical roots of the United States. The white gooey asserts white neutrality, normalizing the belief that white space is the driving force behind innovation and connection. “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopian of War” argues that user experience is merely an illusion of a better and more intuitive experience when in reality, it is instead structured for designers to script how users interact with the software and thus, limiting their behavior to what is permissible. Lialina goes further to discuss and argue against applying user experience principles to military operations, effectively gamifying the act of war and killing, detaching ourselves more from the interface and the experience. </p>

        <ol class="text">
            <li>Would a shift in the racial and social issues in America change the interface? Or vice versa – would a shift in the anti-blackness of the GUI have meaningful changes in American society?</li>
            <li>How can we begin reclaiming user autonomy when interacting with user experience interfaces that are carefully laid out for us?</li>
            <li>Has our perception of reality been altered by algorithms? Do we behave differently based on the actions that we are allowed to do online?</li>
