        <h1>Summaries</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p class="text">In “How to Internet”, Jenny Odell reminisces about the spontaneity of connection with strangers in the superhighway days of the Internet. She laments that the excitement associated with the newness of the Internet’s capabilities barely exist in today’s age of carefully filtered online spaces, and urges us to find new ways to recapture the unrefined yet distinctively human forms of connection by reimagining our current systems. Laurel Schwulst provides a possible solution, tackling what it means to create a website today and the consequent responsibilities we have in making the web a more expressive, inclusive, and individuality-driven space. She uses metaphors to demonstrate the endless possibilities of what websites can be used for and what they can mean. One of my favorites is thinking of a website as a puddle – creating it whenever and being okay with its temporary and incomplete nature, then knowing that where there’s a hole, another puddle (or website/idea) will form again some day. Molly Soda’s website is the ultimate example of injecting our identities into websites through her commentary on corporate controlled content on social media. Its layout and content are unapologetically unique to her style and the interactivity of her website leads viewers down a rabbit hole of her thoughts on digital culture. </p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p class="text">It was so fascinating being able to examine the Internet in a different way through understanding where it came from and how we each relate to its future. Knowing that today, computer programming is widely regarded as a male-dominated field, I never thought that women were the building blocks of it. It was so frustrating to see their existence dwindle when corporations began realizing the potential of this field and pushing the narrative that it was a man’s job. As well, it was interesting to learn that the internet is actually sustained and made up of its users, so the internet is truly what we make of it. But, we need to start shifting away from corporations dominating the internet to individuals shaping it in order to make it benefit the people more. Looking at the internet now, it seems more and more like a reflection of how our world in general is run – there are major gender inequalities in the field and our world is heavily corporate controlled. I truly wonder how our society would be different if we are able to begin making the internet a space for the individual to thrive.</p>
       <h2>Week 4</h2> 
       <p class="text">“Black Gooey Universe” follows the development of technology within Silicon Valley through a racial lens, examining the anti-blackness that has been incorporated into GUI. It emphasizes that the white-dominated corporations replaced the black screen with a white one, erasing Blackness in the same way as the social and historical roots of the United States. The white gooey asserts white neutrality, normalizing the belief that white space is the driving force behind innovation and connection. “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopian of War” argues that user experience is merely an illusion of a better and more intuitive experience when in reality, it is instead structured for designers to script how users interact with the software and thus, limiting their behavior to what is permissible. Lialina goes further to discuss and argue against applying user experience principles to military operations, effectively gamifying the act of war and killing, detaching ourselves more from the interface and the experience. </p>
       
       <h2>Week 5</h2> 
       <p class="text">In her TEDx Talk, Heather Dewey-Hagborg discusses the traces of ourselves that we leave behind through our DNA. Her art of strangers’ portraits, as determined through their left behind DNA, drew attention to a rarely discussed field – biological surveillance – promoting a conversation on whether institutions should have the power to leverage the private information we leave behind in public spaces. Lauren McCarthy’s work chooses to focus more on the discussion of privacy in personal spaces, in the home and in our personal lives. Her work critiques the control that we give AI technologies, like Amazon Alexa, in our homes. Her project LAUREN experiments with the relationship that we have with technologies that oversee and control every aspect of our homes, with the goal of seeing how this experience can change when there’s a human behind the controls instead of AI – can the human understand them better, and does this make them feel like they can relinquish more control? In Sydette Henry’s article, she illuminates the frequent and non-consensual surveillance of black female bodies, stereotyping them and thus, excluding and invalidating their opinions from social issues. </p>
       
       <h2>Week 6</h2> 
       <p class="text">In An Xiao Mina’s talk, she dissects the potency of memes and how they can and historically have been used as tools for social movements. Drawing from the cute cat theory and how activist messages have become embedded in silly memes, she emphasizes how we need to understand that memes hold power, depending on who is using them. Mina also discusses the liaisons between past narratives and current internet culture, showing how many of our current social justice movements stem from hashtags, and as well, how remix culture in pre-internet days has created symbols for movements that are still used and remixed today. Ultimately, she urges us to consider how social movements will navigate spaces filled with more dissensus than before, especially since the internet acts as a vehicle for fragmented views to join together. “In Defense of the Poor Image” describes a visual hierarchy dominated by an insistence on high-resolution, commercialized, and meticulously created images, ushered in by the neoliberal radicalization of culture as commodity and the privatization of media production. As a result, the poor image has become invisible. However, the rise of accessible technology has given more creative control to everyday users, allowing them to actively participate in the creation, distribution, and production of content, transforming the poor image into a popular one. This new imperfect cinema age, although confusing and convoluted at times, has the power to disrupt movements of thought, relinquishing some control back to the people. In Rosa Menkman’s Glitch Studies Manifesto, Menkman discusses society’s constant search for better, more perfect media technologies; she emphasizes that each improvement will always contain imperfections, but we need to begin to view the positive consequences of them rather than the negatives. Through glitch art, she urges us to consider breaking out of the binary of what has been established, instead using noise as disruption for progress. </p>
       
       <h2>Week 7</h2>
       <p class="text">In her TED Talk, through her own experiences, Joy Buolamwini highlights the repeated pattern of facial recognition software being unable to recognize her face, simply because of her skin tone. This reveals a deeper oppressive issue of algorithmic bias, where the training sets given to computers is not inclusive or representative of different races, leading to racial bias issues when these algorithms are used in law enforcement settings. She urges us to prioritize considering who codes, how we code, and why we code, as fairer, more accountable practices will unlock greater equality. Mimi Onuoha discusses the importance of the data collection process rather than only focusing on the results, as that process contains valuable information on the people involved. She seeks to move data collection out of the same sphere as the Middletown report, where at the time, everyone thought the data of that town reflected the data for the rest of America, when in reality, it had erased POC due to them being “complicating factors”; instead, she aims to break away from those patterns of exclusion, collecting data for her projects that previously did not have datasets, hoping to create a more accurate, inclusive representation of our society. In “Afro-now-ism”, Stephanie Dinkins explains that the rise of AI has contributed to old forms of systemic oppression. She proposes “Afro-now-ism”, a way to imagine the world as we need it but in the present, taking the leap to create opportunities for yourself instead of waiting for them in the future.</p>
       
       <h2>Week 9</h2>
       <p class="text">Morehshin Allahyari discusses her work and how it draws attention to the relationships between the West, technological colonialism, capitalism, and terrorism. In particular, her material speculation project on rebuilding some of the artifacts that ISIS destroyed acts as an example of how 3D printing has become harnessed by Western tech companies and become compliant in new colonial practices. She emphasizes the need for collective archiving and resistance by being aware of who is using these technologies and how they are archiving history, and of how the information is used within the public sphere – whether it is privatized or not. In Olivia Ross’ “How to Write Non-Violent Creative Code”, she introduces a guiding concept of reindigenization, working to erase the effects of colonialism on coding and online spaces, returning instead to the values of the land. Through subsections, she reminds us to be conscious of who and what our projects are affecting – whether that is the land, a community, someone’s body or privacy, or even ourselves. Ultimately, she reminds us to keep the creative coding community a safe and welcoming space that seeks to protect and honor what we affect. “Digital Doulas Take Restorative Justice to Cyberspace” explores forms of data trauma and the subsequent response of data healing, coined by Olivia McKayla Ross and further supported by Githere’s work. Data trauma refers to the consequences of the violence enacted by surveillance and racist algorithms, reflective of the power structures in real life; as well, it emphasizes that data tracking can be used to harm people through triggering or exposing ads – a result of users being treated as a set of habits, not as people who can evolve and change. The data that follows us is unforgiving, so this article outlines ways that we can begin healing through prioritizing love over likes. The internet is a permanent addition to our lives, so we need to shift how we engage with the platforms we have.</p>
       
       <h2>Week 10</h2>
       <p class="text">Ari Melenciano encourages us to move away from human-centered design to ecologically-centered design. In her talk, she explains the consequences of industrialist and capitalist thinking on design processes as they have caused us to be selfish and wasteful, not thinking about how our products create boundaries between the human and the nonhuman, excluding and harming other life forms. She urges us to adopt a circular design approach to strive for sustainability, to design with future generations in mind, and to create a vision of what we want and to work backwards towards it. Hamid Khan’s work with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition focuses on dismantling the algorithmic and data-driven predictive policing as it criminalizes locations and reinforces racist stereotypes. He believes that reform is never the solution as you cannot make racism kinder, rather a complete eradication of these types of surveillance programs is best. Audre Lorde questions the position that the white male patriarchy in academics has placed on her, regarding her as one of the only sources of a different perspective. She emphasizes that the tools of a racist patriarchy cannot possibly examine the problems of the patriarchy, in the same way that it is difficult for women who fall outside of society’s definition of acceptable women to truly dismantle the master’s house, or in other words, to be able to thrive within the strength of their differences. She determines that the next step is reeducation in order to embrace our differences.</p>
       
       <h2>Week 11</h2>
       <p class="text">I thought <a href="https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu/works/seedlings_fromhumus/view.html">“Seedlings_: From Humus”</a> by Qianxun Chen and Mariana Roa Oliva had such a fascinating concept about collaborative human and machine-made ecosystems. The most interesting part to me was how word-roots could combine with other roots and merge together, creating word branch-offs that were a combination of the two plants. Viewing the plants that I made together, I could see words scattered everywhere, some hiding others and impeding legibility, however it was interesting that the focus of this work is not to highlight any one particular word or plant, rather it was to see the fruits of the collective efforts of this digital ecosystem.</p>
